## Problem Statement

As students at CU, we often find it challenging to access essential information and services related to campus life. This includes finding suitable hostels, staying updated on events, checking commodity prices, and keeping up with the latest school news. To address this, we're developing the ATC (All Things Chuka) app, a one-stop solution for students to enhance their university experience.

  - Access detailed information about each hostel, including pricing, amenities, and contact details.
