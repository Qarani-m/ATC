1. **State Management and Routing**:
   - For state management and routing, we use the GetX package. Please make sure to adhere to this choice for consistency throughout the project.

2. **Font Usage**:
   - To maintain a consistent look and feel, please use the Poppins font for text elements within the app. You can import it like this:
     ```dart
     import 'package:google_fonts/google_fonts.dart';
     ```
     And then use it in your text styles:
     ```dart
     Text(
       'Example Text',
       style: GoogleFonts.poppins(fontSize: 16),
     )
     ```

3. **Responsiveness**:
   - To ensure that the app is responsive on various screen sizes, we use the `flutter_screenutil` package. Please incorporate this package when designing and developing screens to maintain responsiveness.[flutter_screenutil](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_screenutil)
     ```
     dependencies:
      flutter:
        sdk: flutter
      # add flutter_screenutil
      flutter_screenutil: ^{latest version}
     ```
      ```
     import 'package:flutter_screenutil/flutter_screenutil.dart';

      void main() => runApp(MyApp());

      class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
        const MyApp({Key? key}) : super(key: key);
      
        @override
        Widget build(BuildContext context) {
          //Set the fit size (Find your UI design, look at the dimensions of the device screen and fill it in,unit in dp)
          return ScreenUtilInit(
            designSize: const Size(360, 690),
            minTextAdapt: true,
            splitScreenMode: true,
            // Use builder only if you need to use library outside ScreenUtilInit context
            builder: (_ , child) {
              return MaterialApp(
                debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
                title: 'First Method',
                // You can use the library anywhere in the app even in theme
                theme: ThemeData(
                  primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
                  textTheme: Typography.englishLike2018.apply(fontSizeFactor: 1.sp),
                ),
                home: child,
              );
            },
            child: const HomePage(title: 'First Method'),
          );
        }
      }
